This project use AngularJS 1. Why?
Because I only want to focus on business model of this project. So all I want is to establish the program as soon as possible with my current knowledge. Waiting a few days for learning new technologies is too long. I don't want my passion for this project is cooled down just because of any technologies choice distraction. 

Security:
OAuth2 + JWT token with Password flow. Why?
We need to separated the client and server because in the future, we also need a mobile or a Chrome/Firefox extension.
And the server will provide API for client applications. So we choose OAuth2 as the security protocol.
