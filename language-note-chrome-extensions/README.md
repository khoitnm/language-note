Chrome plugin for language-note
===============================
It helps user to add new vocabularies & expressions to the application in a very convenient way while browsing website.
When a user looks up a meaning of an expression, it will automatically create a new topic (topic's title is the page's title) and then add that expression to the new created topic.
Of course, all the definitions, examples, and test questions of that new expression will be automatically generated.
