Chrome plugin for language-note
===============================
> It helps user to add new vocabularies & expressions to the application in a very convenient way while browsing website.
> When a user looks up a meaning of an expression, it will automatically create a new topic (topic's title is the page's title) and then add that expression to the new created topic.
> Of course, all the definitions, examples, and test questions of that new expression will be automatically generated.

This is the first time I work with Chrome Extension, so the code still be a mess, but it should work! :)
